# Brian Noriega

## I create web and mobile applications
Hey, I have been in the software engineering world for over ten years, and occassionally provide technical direction to a room full of marketing directors. Lately, i've had a focus on React.js and 
Next.js, but also support legacy websites built in WordPress and PHP as a Senior Software Engineer and Manager at Aetna, a CVS Health Company.
